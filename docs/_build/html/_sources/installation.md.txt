```

## Verification

Test your installation:

```python
import spikeflow as sf
print(f"SpikeFlow version: {sf.__version__}")

# Test basic functionality
model = sf.LIF(shape=10)
spikes = model(torch.randn(10))
print(f"âœ… SpikeFlow installed successfully!")
```

## Docker Installation

```bash
docker pull spikeflow/spikeflow:latest
docker run -it spikeflow/spikeflow:latest python
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: CUDA out of memory
