## 🎯 Vision & Key Features

### **Advantages over competitors:**
- **🚀 Multi-Hardware Support** - CPU, GPU, Intel Loihi, SpiNNaker
- **⚡ Ultra-Low Power** - 1000x less energy than traditional NNs
- **🧬 Bio-Inspired Learning** - STDP, Homeostasis, Metaplasticity
- **📱 Edge Deployment** - Optimized for IoT and mobile devices
- **🔧 Developer-Friendly** - PyTorch-like API

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import spikeflow as sf

# Create SNN classifier
model = sf.create_snn_classifier(
    input_size=784,
    hidden_sizes=[128, 64],
    output_size=10,
    backend='cpu'  # or 'loihi' for neuromorphic hardware
)

# Train with STDP
optimizer = sf.optim.STDP(model.parameters())
output = model(data, time_steps=100)
loss = sf.functional.spike_loss(output, target)
```
